                    Do you find that all the books and talks you attend about Agile are sort of fluffy? <br />
                    Do you often feel like all you need is a solid starting point?

                    If you want to see a few handy things that will be usable to you directly when you get back to work, then this is the talk for you.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Of course Agile is more a way of thinking than it is a particular tool or practice, but sometimes you simply have a problem you need to solve and getting a starting point will make a big difference. That is the purpose of this talk and the book it is based on: https://leanpub.com/actionableagiletools/

                <div class="abstract">
                    Most of these tools are very simple and can be implemented in less time than it takes to hear about them. Many of these tools were developed incrementally within teams I worked with, some literally taking years and exposure to a variety of organisations to reach their current state.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Free and Open Source Software has since long proven to be a massive success in many areas, and the same can be said about Open source hardware over the last decade. But what about the chips themselves that are placed on circuit boards by hardware developers and programmed by software developers?
                </div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    This is where the Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) movement comes in. Driven by the same forces as open source software - cost, curiousity, availability, security, flexibility - the FOSSi movement is about using Open Source code and tools to build the chips themselves that are at the heart of most electronic devices. This is hardly a new movement, and the roots can be traced back 20 years from the early days of OpenRISC and OpenCores, but in the last few years there has been an explosion of new projects and technologies coming from industry, academia and hobbyists. The boundaries between hardware and software are dissolving and and we're beginning to see whole new fields open up. This also means that there is an increasing number of software engineers entering the digital design domain, bringing best practices such as CI, modern languages and package dependency handling from the software world.
                </div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    Despite all the recent advances, the world of Open Source Silicon is still unknown even to many people working close to hardware. This presentation will give an overview of the events leading up to the current state of FOSSi. We will look at what lies ahead, both in regards of challenges and opportunitiies, and by taking a quick dive into some of the most promising projects such as RISC-V, LibreCores, FuseSoC and yosys to see how and why they can be used instead of proprietary technologies.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary (or "compiled") packages to end users.
                </div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical binary packages are always generated from a given source. This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously infect or blackmail all developers attempting to reproduce the build.

                    This talk will focus heavily on how exactly software can fail to be reproducible, the tools, tests & specifications we have written to fix & diagnose issues, as well as the many amusing "fails" in upstream's code that have been unearthed by this process. In addition, you will learn what to avoid in your own software as well as the future efforts in the Reproducible Builds arena.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Open source software has always been engineering driven. Most of the people building open source software are engineers with major turn on for features and more features which kind of explains how a lot of open source projects have rich and extremely important features but are a pain to see or work with. This talk aims to deal with this problem of designing in the open which is often neglected. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc. can actually become an arena for usability testing and give extremely promising output only if it follows an effective design process. This talk is also a practical guide for budding designers to get started with open source software.

                <div class="abstract">
                    In many embedded and IoT applications, but also on trusted web servers
                    and end-user devices, read-only and cryptographically protected OS
                    images are essential. In this talk I will discuss how systemd helps
                    with setups like this, how to create and update immutable, stateless
                    and volatile OS images, and how systemd will help you booting and
                    keeping them up.

                <div class="abstract">
                    Discussed technologies will be systemd itself, Verity, the "mkosi"
                    experimental image generator, systemd volatile boot modes, and more.

                <div class="abstract">
                    The Cloud continues to be all the rage, despite the hate most techies have for it ("what does it even mean") and (because techies tend to be right) the confusion about what it means. One thing most people associate the cloud with is: that vague, amorphous place where your data goes after you've captured it with your phone, laptop or fancy IoT device. That place is invariably not under your control - it is how the tech giants provide 'value' (and keep you locked in). It is also the place from where your data leaks, in high profile hacks or direct attacks from, presumably, Russians, or Chinese. Well, and Germans and Italians and everything else, both criminal and, more outrageous, government sanctioned.
                </div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    Nextcloud's ambition is to give you a chance to take it back, that stuff from the cloud. Control it, decide where it is and who has access. And we've built an ecosystem around our web server and apps that helps you do that. You can store and sync your files, calendar and contacts. Share holiday pictures. Listen to music. Keep your passwords secure. Edit documents, with others, collaboratively. Have video calls. All that, and more! Just not yet coffee. But you can get involved and make it happen...
                </div>

                <div class="abstract">
                    And obviously, when you claim to be the future, you have to address the elephant in the room: the past. So I'll talk about why and how we left ownCloud, the project we ourselves started.

                <div class="abstract">
                    In many parts of the world, journalists and human rights activists have their equipment seized or checked by oppressive forces. The information carried by these individuals can be compromising to themselves and their sources. Nowadays, nothing is done to protect this information before it reaches a safe environment, so anyone with a physical access to the journalists' cameras and memory cards can see their content.
