                    All non-trivial software inevitably grows in complexity over time. Regardless of best intentions, with continuous releases of new functionality, design debt threatens to cripple our applications: they become confusing and increasingly hard to understand and use.

He then received a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Pavia despite his aversion toward modern technology. He left the University after getting his Ph.D. because he didn't want to write articles. He now works as a freelance writing device drivers and, um...articles. He used to be a young hacker before his babies were born; he's now an old advocate of Free Software who developed a bias for non-PC computer platforms.</div>
